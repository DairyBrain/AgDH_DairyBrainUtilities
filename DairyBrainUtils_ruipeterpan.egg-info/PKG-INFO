Description: # AgDH_DairyBrainUtils
        
        ## About
        AgDH_DairyBrainUtils is a PyPI package with some basic functionalities for interacting with a database along with some other Dairy-Brain-specific utilities.
        
        ## Usage
        To install the package, do:
        
        `pip3 install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ DairyBrainUtilities-ruipeterpan==0.0.4`
        
        Once installed, we recommend you to import the package with `import DairyBrainUtils as dbu`.
        
        A list of functions that are available for use are:
        
        * create_table_if_doesnt_exist(db_engine, table_name, sql_statement)
        * create_table(db_engine, table_name, sql_statement)
        * populate_table_from_csv(table_name, csv_location, db_engine)
        * execute_statement(statement, db_engine)
        * drop_table(table_name, db_engine)
        * has_table(table_name, db_engine)
        * create_schema(db_engine, schema_name)
        
        
        ## Development
        See [this](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/) tutorial for guidance on packaging a Python project and uploading it to the PyPI (Python Package Index).
        [This](https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject) is a sample project with the best format.
        
        
        To publish a new version of the package, edit `./DairyBrainUtils/__init__.py`, change the version number in `setup.py`, and publish the distribution archives following the tutorial.
        
        More specifically, do:
        
        ```
        python3 -m pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel
        python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
        ```
        Now, a `dist` directory should be created with two files. If the package is to be hosted on a local server, just take the `.whl` file and use `pip` to [install](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27885397/how-do-i-install-a-python-package-with-a-whl-file) the package. 
        
        For uploading the distribution packages to TestPyPI, do:
        ```
        python3 -m pip install --upgrade twine
        python3 -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
        ```
        
        Use `__token__` when prompted to enter the username. For the password, use the token value, including the `pypi-` prefix.
